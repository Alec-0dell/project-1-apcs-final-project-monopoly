Overlake Themed Monopoly Project Plan

The code would have multiple classes: chance cards, players, each place on the board (with
subclasses - action, go to jail, free parking, paycheck, etc.), houses and hotels. Board is an array, with each player having instance variables
relating to each action. The game itself would host four players and would be overlake themed. Player wins when everyone else goes bankrupt.
